### This section contains Some of the Problem i found related to Trie Data Structure
####
1.G_yasa_and_the_mysterious_tree.cpp well this question is not that intresting only if you how , if you are given an array and q queries x , such that XOR of x^array[i] should be maximum. To solve we create Trie data structure on the binary representation of the elements in the array , then we can easily find the answer in log(n).
