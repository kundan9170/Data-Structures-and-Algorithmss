#### This section contains the code for finding Strongly connected components in the Graph.
1. Flight_route_check.cpp gives us the task to find if it is possible to go from any airport to any other airport in the Graph which basically boils downs to finding the no. of SCCs in the Graph. If it is one. Then we can do that. To achieve this we do the DFS and also maintain the low-link value of the node and also we keeps the node on the stack that we have visited , now while doing dfs we must land on the node which we visited earlier if there exists a cycle , and all the node that are part of teh cycle will belong to the SCCs. Then while backtracking we propagate that low link value among all nodes that are part of that cycle and while backtracing if we reach that node whose low-link value is equals to its id. we stop there and add all the node on the stack to that point to one SCCs.
2. Planet_and_Kingdom.cpp Its the same question but need to count number of SCCs. Excatly the same algo we will follow.
