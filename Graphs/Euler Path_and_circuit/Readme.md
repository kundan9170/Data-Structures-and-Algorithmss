#### This Section contains few of the problem related to finding Euler path and Ciruit. 
1. Mail_delivery.cpp contains the code to find Euler ciruit in the graph that is how one can start from one post office and visiting the all raods only once and comeback to the post office. A simple modified DFS does the trick. Where we keep deleting the edge we travesed on the graph , for that we make adjacency list with the set container. And also keep track of outdegree or if adjacency is empty. if outdegree is 0 , then we add that node to the stack.
2. Teleporter_path.cpp is same but finding Euler Path in directed Graph, and we know the Theorem which states that Euler path can only exists if excatly one node have outdegree greater than indegree by 1 and also excatly one node have indegree greater than outdegree by 1 or else every node have indegree equal to outdegree.
